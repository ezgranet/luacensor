\title{\texttt{LuaCensor}:\\A package for redacting sensitive information}

\begin{document}
\maketitle
\tableofcontents
\section{Very Quick Guide}
\subsection{Purpose}
This package redacts sensitive information using \texttt{Lua}, and adds accessibility support.
\subsection{Usage}
The package is called with:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\usepackage{luacensor}
\end{minted}

Sensitive information is enclosed within the command:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\cnsr{John Smith}
\end{minted}

When the outputted document is intended for authorised readers who are supposed to see sensitive information, no further action is needed.  When the outputted document is for general audiences, who are \textit{not} supposed to see sensitive information, add the following line to the preamble:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\cnsrtrue
\end{minted}

This activates the censoring globally.
\subsection{Requirements}
This package will \textbf{only} work in Lua\LaTeX. The package works out of the box with a standard \TeX\ distribution, but ideally, I would strongly suggest installing the free (\textit{libre} \& \textit{gratis}) `Redacted' font from Google Fonts, which gives a quite æsthetically pleasing black bar effect.\footnote{Available at: \url{https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Redacted}.}
\subsection{\color{red}Warning}
The package is completely effective at censoring text formatted with normal \LaTeX\ commands, by which I mean that it is impossible for someone to ascertain the original text (or even its precise length) from the outputted \MakeLowercase{\textsc{PDF}} when the \verb|\cnsrtrue| option has been activated. 

 However, math mode is used, it will censor numbers, but not operators or \TeX\ (as opposed to Unicode) operators.  This is probably fine for most instances, but unacceptable where security is of the highest priority, and I would not really recommend using this package to censor highly secret formulæ; the \texttt{censor} package in your \TeX\ distribution will do a better job of that.  The package is set to completely disappear the output (as opposed to black bar over) of the \texttt{math}, \texttt{align}, \texttt{equation}, \texttt{tabular}, and a few other environments, as disappearing these environments proved more secure than the piecemeal blacking out I saw.  It is probable that there are packages and macros that will break the \texttt{cnsr} macro, and therefore, care should be taken to always examine output before public distribution.
 \subsection{Demonstration}
 \begin{quote}
 \begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize,
,breaklines]{latex}
%In the preamble: \usepackage{luacensor}
\begin{quote}
\cnsrtrue\footnotesize Whereas recognition of the \cnsr{inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family} is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

\cnsr{Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people,}
 \end{minted}

\section{More detailed information}
\subsection{Purpose}
This package is a relatively lightweight and aesthetically pleasing censorship solution which includes accessibility features to allow screen readers to be aware that content has been redacted.  
\subsection{The censoring mechanism}
The package uses Luas's \texttt{toks}  filter to replace all \textsc{utf8} characters with a single glyph (• in the case of Redacted, and a Unicode black rectangle in the fallback \TeX\ default font Source Sans Pro).  In both font options, these combine visually into a single line (though this can be deconstructed in a text editor).

  However, while changing all characters into a single character is effective in \textit{most} cases, this alone would not be sufficiently secure for reliable usage.  This is because knowing the length of a censored name could be combined with other information in, for example, a Family Court judgment, to allow for what lawyers call `jigsaw identification' (\textit{eg}, where there is only one person with an eight letter surname who meets the other details given in the judgment).  

Therefore, the package adds an extra layer of security by randomly changing the length of strings during the censorship phase; censored strings can thus be either longer or shorter by a few characters.  This means that while the area of the blacked out content will be \textit{approximately} similar to the length of the uncensored string (which means wireframing more or less works), it cannot be used to reverse engineer information about the censored content.  

\subsection{The accessibility feature}
One concern about document redaction is ensuring that visually impaired readers of your document, who use screen reading software to listen to your text, may encounter problems with censored content.  If the screen reading software skips over the censored text altogether, it will be a very confusing jump for the visually impaired user.  If the screen reading software reads the replacement characters, it will be very annoying for the visually impaired reader to hear, in a censored paragraph, the same character being read out \textit{ad nauseam} (\textit{eg}, `Asterisk, asterisk, asterisk…').

To overcome this limitation, the package uses the \texttt{accsup} package to add an `actual text' feature which will lead screen readers (and utilities like \texttt{pdftotext}) to replace the string of replacement characters with the two words `TEXT REDACTED'. This also will be encountered by naïve users who try to outdo the package by copying and pasting the black blocks from Adobe™ Acrobat or Reader.  (However, because other PDF readers, like Apple's Preview, do not implement accessibility features, this is \textbf{not} an additional security feature and is not on its own sufficient to work for redaction; if it were otherwise, the rest of the package would be unnecessary)



\subsection{Bugs and development}
All bugs, feature requests, or other technical points should be submitted to the package's official Github page.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/ezgranet/luacensor}}

\subsection{Licensing}
The software is free and open-sour ce software licensed under the Latex Public Project Licence.\footnote{\url{https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/}} 


\subsection{Some useful advice}
This package is really good at some things, but if you find it breaks down on censoring complex \LaTeX\ code, the existing \texttt{censor} package on \textsc{ctan} is excellent (albeit less good with accessibility), and works with non-\texttt{Lua} versions of \TeX. Incidentally, you can use both this package and \texttt{censor} in the same file without trouble; this (\textit{not} a penchant for annoying tech-speak) is why the main command in this package is \texttt{cnsr} without vowels.

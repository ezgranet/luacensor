# luacensor
## About
A very lightweight `LaTeX` package for censoring sensitive information using `LuaLaTeX` to redact the text, and the typeface ‘Censor’ (a modified version of the OFL typeface ‘Flow Block’) to change it from a series of Unicode Black Squares (■) into suitable black lines.  This approach to censorship is more accessibility friendly than simply turning censored text into an unreadable image, since a screen reader will indicate the censored text.  It also has an advantage over highlighting based censorship, in that the `Lua` code randomly changes the length of strings, such that on average censored text is the same length, but any individual string may be a different length.  This matters for preventing ‘jigsaw identification’, by which the otherwise meaningless information of the length of say, a redacted surname, could be used to narrow down the possible identity of someone when there were several possible candidates with differing names.    The package is also quite lightweight, since the generation of the obfuscation takes little code, and the generation of the black marker effect is left to Censor.  However, the installation of the Censor  typeface is optional, and users without Censor installed will instead have the unicode black squares appear, generated by the `TeX` default typeface Deja Vu Sans.    Credit is given in the source code to the helpful Tex.SE users who aided with this package's development.

## Usage

The main command for the package is:
`\cnsr{}`, which will censor athe argument of the macro where the document contains the statement `\cnsrtrue`.  This global switch allows users to easily change between documents without redaction (for example, for the eyes of judicial authorities), and documents with redaction (for public consumption).  There are no other settings.

## Requirements
`LuaLaTeX` and and a working `TeX` distribution.
